TI = usb_to_gpio.USB_TO_GPIO()                                                  # Initialize & opens an instrument reference
TI.configure(pec_enabled=False)                                                 # Selects 100-KHz/400-KHz bus speed & PEC mode
TI.send_byte(dev_addr=0x001, cmd_addr=0x00)                                     # Performs a “Send_Byte”
TI.write_byte(dev_addr=0x01, cmd_addr=0x00, data=0x00)                          # Performs a “Write_Byte”
TI.close()                                                                      # Close the device reference
